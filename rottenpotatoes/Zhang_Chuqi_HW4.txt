Feature: search for movies by director
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and search on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/movies_by_director.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:1
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |
      | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott | 1982-06-25   |
      | Alien        | R      |              | 1979-05-25   |
      | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas | 1971-03-11   |

  Scenario: add director to existing movie                # features/movies_by_director.feature:16
    When I go to the edit page for "Alien"                # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    And I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:60
    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott" # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:30

  Scenario: find movie with same director                       # features/movies_by_director.feature:22
    Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the Similar Movies page for "Star Wars" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "THX-1138"                                 # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
    But I should not see "Blade Runner"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123

  Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path) # features/movies_by_director.feature:29
    Given I am on the details page for "Alien"                             # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    Then I should not see "Ridley Scott"                                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the home page                                      # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "'Alien' has no director info"                        # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
